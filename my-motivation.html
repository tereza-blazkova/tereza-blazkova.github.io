        <h2>Why I Decided to Create This Website</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website to have a personal space where I can share my research, thoughts, and professional journey. In today’s digital world, having an online presence is crucial for academics and professionals alike. It not only allows me to showcase my work, but also enables me to connect with a wider audience interested in similar topics.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals for This Website</h2>
        <p>
            My primary goal for this website is to share insights about my research on algorithm auditing and responsible AI in education. I hope to make complex topics accessible to a broader audience and provide updates on my ongoing projects and publications. Additionally, I want this site to serve as a platform for collaboration, inviting others to engage with my work or propose new ideas.
        </p>

        <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
        <p>
            Over time, I plan to publish blog posts related to algorithmic fairness, data science, and my experience as a PhD student. I’ll also share resources that I’ve found useful in my research and professional development. My posts will be a mix of academic content, tutorials, and personal reflections.
        </p>
