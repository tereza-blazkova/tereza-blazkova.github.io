        <h2>Why I Decided to Create This Website</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website to have a personal space where I can share my research, thoughts, and academic journey.
            My primary aim for this website is to share insights about my research on algorithm auditing and responsible AI in education. I hope to make complex topics accessible to a broader audience and provide updates on my ongoing projects. Additionally, I want this site to serve as a platform for collaboration, inviting others to engage with my work or propose new ideas.
        </p>

        <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
        <p>
            Over time, I plan to publish blog posts related to social data science, and my experience as a PhD student. I’ll also share resources that I’ve found useful in my research and professional development. My posts will be a mix of academic content and personal reflections.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
